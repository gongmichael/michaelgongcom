# 1.Out of sample forecasting performance statistics aggregated
The figure below plots the out of sample forecasting error (RMSE) and mean correct prediction. DFMX 
represents DFMX model with 1 idiosyncratic factor, and DFMX3i represents DFMX model 3 idiosyncratic
factors.

The figure below plots the comparison of 3 model, where `1` indicates DFM model has the lowest forecasting
error, `2` indicates DFMX has the lowest forecasting error, and `3` indicates DFMX3i has the lowest forecasting
error. `Win share` reports the percentage of models wins (in terms of lower RMSE).
